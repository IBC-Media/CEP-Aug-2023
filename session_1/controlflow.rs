/*
Rust needs to know at compile time what type the number variable is, definitively. Knowing the type of number lets the compiler verify the type is valid everywhere we use number. Rust wouldnâ€™t be able to do that if the type of number was only determined at runtime; the compiler would be more complex and would make fewer guarantees about the code if it had to keep track of multiple hypothetical types for any variable.
